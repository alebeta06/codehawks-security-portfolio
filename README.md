# CodeHawks Security Portfolio

This repository contains my portfolio of smart contract security audits completed as part of the Cyfrin Updraft Smart Contract Security Auditor program.

## About

- üìö Here I will document all my audit reports, findings, and learning progress as I advance through the Updraft program by Cyfrin.
- üõ°Ô∏è Each audit report is a real exercise on smart contract security, covering vulnerabilities, best practices, and recommendations.

## First Audit: Password Store

https://github.com/Cyfrin/3-passwordstore-audit

- **2025-7-3-passwordstore-audit.pdf**:
- My first audit, focused on a simple password storage contract. I identified critical issues such as lack of access control and on-chain secret exposure.

## Second Audt: Puppy Raffle

https://github.com/Cyfrin/4-puppy-raffle-audit

- **2025-7-23-puppyraffle-audit.pdf**:
- This project is to enter a raffle to win a cute dog NFT. The protocol should do the following:

1. Call the `enterRaffle` function with the following parameters:
   1. `address[] participants`: A list of addresses that enter. You can use this to enter yourself multiple times, or yourself and a group of your friends.
2. Duplicate addresses are not allowed
3. Users are allowed to get a refund of their ticket & `value` if they call the `refund` function
4. Every X seconds, the raffle will be able to draw a winner and be minted a random puppy
5. The owner of the protocol will set a feeAddress to take a cut of the `value`, and the rest of the funds will be sent to the winner of the puppy.
## More coming soon!
