# CodeHawks Security Portfolio

This repository contains my portfolio of smart contract security audits completed as part of the Cyfrin Updraft Smart Contract Security Auditor program.

## About

- üìö Here I will document all my audit reports, findings, and learning progress as I advance through the Updraft program by Cyfrin.
- üõ°Ô∏è Each audit report is a real exercise on smart contract security, covering vulnerabilities, best practices, and recommendations.

## First Audit

- **2025-7-3-passwordstore-audit.pdf**: My first audit, focused on a simple password storage contract. I identified critical issues such as lack of access control and on-chain secret exposure.

## More coming soon!
